# Sprint 7 project -Lior Edri
This project designed to perform HTTP requests for Urban Grocers app.
I used GET, PUT, POST and DELETE requests.
It includes two tests for each request type, out of 8 tests, 7 have passed, and 1 has failed.
The failed test is the second test in the GET request, negative testing.
